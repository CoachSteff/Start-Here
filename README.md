# Welcome to CoachSteff's AI Workspace

**Building human-centered tools for the AI era**

This is the home base for my open-source projects focused on helping professionals work smarter with AI. I'm Steff VanHaverbeke (CoachSteff), an AI adoption coach and facilitator. I run CS Workx and am a partner at [The House of Coaching](https://thehouseofcoaching.be/). My work centers on the human side of AI: cognitive agility, strategic thinking, and the capabilities that make us irreplaceable.

The projects here reflect that philosophy. They're practical tools and frameworks designed to augment human intelligence, not replace it.

## What You'll Find Here

### [superprompt](https://github.com/CoachSteff/superprompt)
A comprehensive framework for AI prompt engineering and context management. This project helps you structure prompts that actually work, maintain context across conversations, and get consistently better results from AI tools.

**When to use it:** You're working with AI assistants regularly and want to move beyond basic prompting into systematic, repeatable workflows.

---

### [imagineering](https://github.com/CoachSteff/imagineering)
Systematic creative problem-solving frameworks built for AI-augmented work. This repo brings together structured thinking models to help you tackle complex challenges with AI as your thinking partner.

**When to use it:** You're facing complex problems that need creative solutions, and you want frameworks to guide your AI-assisted thinking process.

### [cs-crawler-mcp](https://github.com/CoachSteff/cs-crawler-mcp)
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that adds web crawling functionality to your AI workflows. Built in Python, this tool lets you pull in real-world data and context from across the web.

**When to use it:** You need to integrate live web data into your AI tools and want a clean, systematic way to do it.

## The Bigger Picture

These tools are part of my work helping professionals become what I call **Superworkers**: people who strategically combine human capabilities with AI to create exponential value. Not by working harder, but by working differently.

If you're interested in the human side of AI adoption, cognitive agility, or building capabilities that matter in an AI-driven world, you're in the right place.

I've added The House of Coaching in the intro paragraph and included a link in the contact section. Want me to save this as a file you can upload to your repo, or would you like any other tweaks first?
